    --> ask_personal_info
        I made the function to return values of name, gender, age, weight, height, choice-of-exercise
        which are according to what the user input.
        I also integraded "try, except" in case of the input value is invalid.
        If the input value is invalid, it will loop the process until user enter valid choice.

        The function correctly return user's bmr value for both male and female cases.
        I also set the default gender to be male and default age of 30

        Calculated tdee values of sedentary, lightly-active, moderately-active, very-active, extremely-active
        are correctly defined and return, each value will be rounded up to a full number no matter if the decimal is not exceed 5.

        Correctly return value of meal number, entree, dessert, drink, meal-calories, cumulative-calories
        in string sentences.

    --> compute_excess_calories
        Calculate kcal from, needed_calories - consumed_calories
        the check if kcal is above or equal to 0, this mean the user doesn't have excess calories
        else means, user have excess calories.
        After passing the checking condotion, the value will be return either 0 or excess kcal value.

    --> compute_exercise_duration
        The function will return the total time in minute, for how much time user should do exercise to get rid of excess calories,
        by calculate from calories burned per hour of the choosen exercise, then return the full number if the calculated value.
